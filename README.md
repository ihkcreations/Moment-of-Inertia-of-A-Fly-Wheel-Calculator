## How and when to use this application ?
After running the lab simulation of the above link, you will get these values when determining the n1, n2 and t values
  
  - Mass of load, **M** in kg
  - Height of load, **h** in meter
  - Radius of axle, **r** in meter
  - Number of rotations of **n1**
  - Number of rotations of **n2**
  - Time duration of n2 rotations, **t** in seconds

All we have to do is, use these values in our application(s) and you will get the results.

**Example given below:**

    This calculation was done using the PC application. All the values were acquired from the simulation except the Angular Velocity and Moment of Inertia.
